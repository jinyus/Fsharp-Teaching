Data visualization
 - Should we also talk about gestalt here? (Timing is tight and it's not clear how relevant
   that is, but it seems like an obvious place for it.)
   
Evaluation
 - This is a bit too long!
 
Metaphors 
 - Wording of metonymy in the lecture is odd 

Speicalist users
 - Somewhat unstructured - maybe go from low-level to higher level?
 - Also, add "roles of variables" (roles in which variables appear)
