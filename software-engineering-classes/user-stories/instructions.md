# User stories

In this class, you will work in small groups to write user stories that capture the
requirements of a software system. You should write a number of user stories and then
lead a brief follow-up conversation about each of the user story. In the conversation,
you should clarify the nature of the problem and learn what other functionality you
may need to specify.

## Background

_"User stories are short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of
the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
They typically follow a simple template:"_
([source](https://www.agile-scrum.be/whats-great-scrum-methodology/user-stories-important-agile/))

    As a <type of user>, I want <some functionality> so that <some reason>.

The user story serves as a specification of the requirements for a system, but also as
a starting point for a conversation about the problem. Given a user story, you can have
a follow-up conversation with the customer where you ask for details about specific
aspects of the story and clarify your understanding of the problem.

In this class, you will write a number of user stories and lead a follow-up conversation.

## Scenario

For your user stories, consider a mobile app for booking a table in a restaurant. A part
of the exercise is to think about the problem from a perspective of a user and come up
with your own user stories, so we do not give you a detailed description. However,
the app should allow typical things that you might expect such as:

* Search for restaurants based on location, availability and cuisine
* Make a booking for a restaurant on a given date and time
* View restaurants matching some criteria on a map, etc.

## Exercise

For the class, form groups of 4-5 people. In each group, you should:

1. Each person will write two user stories in the above format that capture some
   of the requirements for the booking app. You should coordinate this with your
   colleagues to avoid writing the same user stories.

2. Once you have written the user stories, each of you should pick one of your
   user stories to have a conversation about. The author of the story will be
   the "customer", everyone else in the group will be the "developer", trying to
   get more detailed understanding of the requirement.

3. Have a conversation about the user story. The developers should ask questions
   and the customer should answer them, based on their requirements for the app.

4. In group, collaborate to summarize the key points from the conversation. What
   unexpected insights you learned from the conversation? Is there anything that
   would change how you technically implement the system? Was the user story
   self-contained, or did it reveal further user stories that need to be written down?

5. Share your user stories and key takeaways in [this shared Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cN4_D6uuseYmyBzSO0EDwj8GFAHqZYDP9A44GcsaM4I/edit?usp=sharing).
   Beware. This is an experiment! Anyone can edit anything in the document, so be
   nice. This is not marked, but you can learn from others if the experiment works.
