Tomas Petricek's teaching
=========================

This repository contains various teaching materials I created for the courses taught at
University of Kent and possibly elsewhere. The materials are generally
created using [FsReveal](http://github.com/fsprojects/FsReveal). For my industry talks
see [my Talks repository](http://github.com/tpetricek/Talks/) and for older materials
(before 2015), check out [my old Documents repository](http://github.com/tpetricek/Documents/).
